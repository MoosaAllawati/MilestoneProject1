          <h3>
            Moosa Al Lawati is a London-based civil engineer, and classical
            guitarist from Muscat, the Sultanate of Oman. Self-taught from the
            age of twenty, Moosa grew to perform in Flamenco and Arabesque
            flavours of music with his odd time-signatures, rhythmic
            compositions, and fingerpicking styles.<br />
            <br />
            His independent album "Fireworks in Andalusia" will release in June
            2024 across all major music platforms. He aspires to support guitar
            learners of all ages, and collaborate with emerging bands or artists
            from the Arab world and beyond. If you're interested in holding an
            event, learning how to play, or general inquiries,
